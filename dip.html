<h2>Nicole's Best Spinach Artichoke Dip Tips</h2>
<p>All the best dips start with cream cheese, according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). This spinach artichoke dip is proof! Here are
   a few of Nicole's tips and tricks for making the best spinach artichoke dip of your life:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>It's important that your cream cheese is softened before you start mixing the ingredients. Otherwise, it won't incorporate well.</li>
    <li>Mix everything together before you add the spinach and artichokes. You'll want to get the cream cheese mixture well-blended first so the veggies stay intact.</li>
    <li>Squeeze out as much moisture as you can before you add the spinach so the dip doesn't get runny.</li>
    <li>If you want to make spinach artichoke dip in advance, mix all the ingredients together — but don't bake it. Store it in the fridge for a day or two, then bake it right before serving.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Serve With Spinach Artichoke Dip</h2>
<p>Serve this spinach artichoke dip hot with tortilla chips, crackers, pita bread, or vegetables. If you want to go the extra mile, try making homemade bagel chips or homemade crostini.</p>
<h2>How to Store Spinach Artichoke Dip</h2>
<p>Allow the spinach artichoke dip to cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat in the oven.</p>
<h2>Can You Freeze Spinach Artichoke Dip?</h2>
<p>You can freeze spinach artichoke dip for up to three months. However, we don't recommend it — the creamy ingredients will separate and become watery during the freezing and thawing process.</p>
