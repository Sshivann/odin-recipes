        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A twist on a Philly Cheesesteak featuring Kansas City style "burnt ends" barbecue and traditional cheesesteak toppings like sauteed onions, pickled peppers, and cheese whiz.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ pounds beef chuck roast (should be very well-marbled)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons barbecue dry rub</li>
            <li>½ cup Kansas City style BBQ sauce</li>
            <li>4 sandwich or hoagie rolls</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container cheese whiz, or sliced cheese as needed</li>
            <li>⅔ cup sautéed onions</li>
            <li>⅔ cup chopped jarred pickled peppers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Season beef with dry rub, and double wrap in foil. Place on a sheet pan or in a baking dish, seam side up, and roast in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Let rest for 1 hour. Unwrap and transfer to a cutting board. Reserve all juices. Cut into 1-inch cubes and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add cooking juices, more dry rub if desired, and bbq sauce. Mix well, wrap, and refrigerate overnight.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Transfer beef into a shallow baking dish and brush generously with bbq sauce.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Roast in the preheated oven until meat starts to char around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and brush again with bbq sauce. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Roast until the "burnt ends" are as tender as you want, about 1 1/2 hours more.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Transfer the "burnt ends" onto the rolls, and finish with cheese whiz, onions, peppers, and green onions.</p>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Serve and enjoy!</p>
