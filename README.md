My first project in Foundations called Recipes.
This was a fun little project to built out a recipies website. I learned a lot about Git and Github as I committed often, usually after a page was created and linked to index.html. i got practice on typing to write good commit comments, althouught I feel there is much left to be desired on that part. I will continue to improve on this as i get more practice.
I also got to put into practice all i have learned in Foundationt thus far, like, boilerplates, headings, paragraphs, alternative text, images, links, unordered, and ordered lists.
I am enjoying the journey.....
